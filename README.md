# Raspberry_Hub

## Grabs multiple APIs from different places ##

I would like this project to do a few things
* Display things from a Twitter API
* Display weather from AccuWeather
* Any other APIs that come to mind

### File structure
#### access.py
The access.py is used for granting access to your Twitter API
